## Introduction

This page provides a summary of all the pages that I have written about Try Hack Me's Advent of Cyber 2022 event. On each page, I study the topics covered on each day, exploring both the theory and practical applications. However, I do not include a write-up on how to solve the tasks. Instead, I focus on a deeper understanding of the subject matter.
