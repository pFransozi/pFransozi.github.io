Here is an example of a code snippet that has a potential application security problem:

Copy code
def update_user_info(user_id, new_info):
  user = database.fetch_user_by_id(user_id)
  user.update(new_info)
  database.save(user)
This code allows a user to update their own information in the database by providing their user ID and the new information. However, there is no validation or sanitization of the new_info parameter, which could potentially allow an attacker to modify the user's information in an unintended or malicious way. For example, an attacker could provide new_info with a field called is_admin set to true, which would give them administrator privileges on the system.

To address this issue, the code could be modified to validate and sanitize the new_info parameter before saving it to the database. This could involve checking the fields in new_info against a whitelist of allowed fields, and sanitizing the values of those fields to remove any potentially harmful content.
