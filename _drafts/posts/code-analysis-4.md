Here is an example of a more complex code snippet with a potential application security problem, also written in C:

Copy code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <openssl/evp.h>

#define HASH_LEN 32

void hash_password(char *password, unsigned char *hash) {
  EVP_MD_CTX *mdctx;
  const EVP_MD *md;
  unsigned int md_len;

  md = EVP_get_digestbyname("SHA-256");
  if (md == NULL) {
    printf("Unknown message digest\n");
    return;
  }

  mdctx = EVP_MD_CTX_create();
  EVP_DigestInit_ex(mdctx, md, NULL);
  EVP_DigestUpdate(mdctx, password, strlen(password));
  EVP_DigestFinal_ex(mdctx, hash, &md_len);
  EVP_MD_CTX_destroy(mdctx);
}

int main() {
  char password[HASH_LEN];
  unsigned char hash[HASH_LEN];

  printf("Enter password: ");
  fgets(password, HASH_LEN, stdin);

  // Remove newline character from password
  password[strlen(password) - 1] = '\0';

  hash_password(password, hash);

  printf("Hashed password: ");
  for (int i = 0; i < HASH_LEN; i++) {
    printf("%02x", hash[i]);
  }
  printf("\n");

  return 0;
}
This code implements a simple password hashing function using the OpenSSL library. It takes a password as input, hashes it using the SHA-256 algorithm, and prints the resulting hash to the screen.

However, this code has a potential security issue because it uses the fgets function to read the password from the user's input. This function reads up to a specified number of characters from the input, but it also includes the newline character at the end of the input in the resulting string. As a result, the code removes the last character of the password string (the newline character) before hashing it, which can cause problems if the password is exactly 32 characters long (the length of the hash).

To address this issue, the code could be modified to use a different function or method for reading the password from the user's input. For example, the scanf function could be used instead of fgets, which reads input until it encounters a whitespace character (such as a newline). This would prevent the newline character from being included in the password string, and would allow the code to handle passwords of any length.
