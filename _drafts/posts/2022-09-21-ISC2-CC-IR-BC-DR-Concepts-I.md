## Introduction

Here we continue ISC² CC from second chapter of the self-paced "Certified in Cybersecurity". The first chapter start [here]({% post_url 2022-09-21-ISC2-CC-Foundational-Concepts-I %}){:target="_blank"}.

This post is based on three topics:

* **incident response**;
* **business continuity**;
* **disaster recovery**;

## incident response basic aspects

Let's try some definitions:

1. it is a plan that is used to respond to unexpected changes in operating conditions to keep the business operating;

2. it is **the process** of responding to and managing the aftermath of a security breach or cyber attack, involving a series of steps to contain the breach, minimize damage, and start the recovery process. It includes activities such as identifying the cause of the incident, determining its scope, collecting evidence, taking corrective action, and communicating with stakeholders;

Based on those two definitions, let's try draw some propositions:

1. as in every cybersecurity activities, incident response is an ongoing process;
2. even though it is a response plan, it requires awareness of the operation conditions and mechanisms to detect unexpected changes in it;
3. the critical events are security breach or cyber attack
4. some steps: contain the breach, minimize damage, start the recovery process
5. some activities: identifying the cause of the incident, determining its scope, collecting evidence, taking corrective action, communicating with stakeholders.

In every field of knowledge there are terms that describe that field and support definitions, the incident terminology is:

* **breach** is an event of loss of control, unauthorized disclosure, unauthorized acquisition, or any similar occurrence, where a person other than an authorized user accesses or potentially accesses personally identifiable information;

* **event** is any observable occurrence** in a network or system;

* **exploit** is a particular attack that exploits system vulnerabilities;

* **incident** is an event that actually or potentially jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity or availability of an information system or the information the system processes, stores or transmits.

* **intrusion** is a security event, or a combination of events, that constitutes a deliberate security incident in which an intruder gains, or attempts to gain, access to a system or system resource without authorization.

* **threat** is any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact organizational operations, organizational assets, individuals, other organizations or the nation through an information system via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, modification of information and/or denial of service.

* **vulnerability** is weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls or implementation that could be exploited by a threat source.

* **zero day** is a previously unknown system vulnerability with the potential of exploitation without risk of detection or prevention because it does not, in general, fit recognized patterns, signatures or methods.

## the goal of incident response

The priority of IR is to protect life, health and safety, which means always to choose safety first. The primary goal of incident management is to be prepared, which requires having a policy and a response plan that will lead the organization through the crisis. A plan avoids to be taken by surprise at unexpected events.

This ongoing process is also called crisis management and it must help preserve business viability and survival. The incident response process is aimed at reducing the impact of an incident so the organization can resume the interrupted operations as soon as possible. Note that incident response planning is a subset of the greater discipline of business continuity management (BCM).
