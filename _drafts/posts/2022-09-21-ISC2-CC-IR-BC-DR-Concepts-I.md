Here we continue ISC² CC from second chapter of the self-paced "Certified in Cybersecurity". The first chapter start [here]({% post_url 2022-09-21-ISC2-CC-Foundational-Concepts-I %}){:target="_blank"}.

This post is based on three topics:

* **incident response**;

* **disaster recovery**;

## incident response

Incident response is the process of responding to and managing the aftermath of a security breach or cyber attack. It involves a series of steps to contain the breach, minimize damage, and start the recovery process. It includes activities such as identifying the cause of the incident, determining its scope, collecting evidence, taking corrective action, and communicating with stakeholders.
