## Introduction

Here we'll continue ISC² CC foundational concepts, talking about risk management process concepts. This is a sequence of a story started [in this link]({% post_url 2022-09-21-ISC2-CC-Foundational-Concepts-I %}){:target="_blank"}

Before we reach our target, let's talk a little bit about concepts and risk management process.

**Why do we have to learn about concepts?** Frankly, we do not have, except if we want to have tools to handle the chaos of reality. Concepts help us to see reality less chaotic, helping us to manage real-life situations, both the most ordinary and the most extraordinary.

Our scenarios are on risk management in a cybersecurity context and nowadays it means any risk that **can affect confidentiality, integrity and availability of a business**. For that, risk management must become a process, **an ongoing concern**, in any organization, by which any risk must be assess and analyze **in a continuous and comprehensive way**. And in a security team, the work pass through risk assessment, analysis, mitigation, remediation and communication.

So, this story covers:

* **risk management terminology**;
* **risk identification**;
* **risk assessment**;
* **risk treatment**;
* **risk priorities**.

## Risk Management Terminology

Discuss terminology is a way to delimite the scope of a topic, since any scope of a topic is delimited by the terms, the concepts that ground it. It's tautology!

* **risk** is a measure of the extent to which an entity is threatened by a **potential** circumstance or event. It is often expressed as a combination of: the adverse impacts that would arise if the circumstance or event occurs, and the likelihood of occurrence;
* **asset** is something in need of protection because it has value to the organization. It could be a tangible asset or intangible, such as information;
* **vulnerability** is a gap or ***weakness*** in an organization's protection of its valuable assets, including information. A vulnerability is an inherent weakness or flaw in a system or component, which, if triggered or acted upon, **could cause a risk event to occur**. **An organization’s security team strives to identify and to decrease its vulnerability**. For that, it is critical has the pointer of view of an attacker: **Why would we be an attractive target Managing vulnerabilities starts with one simple step: Learn what they are**;
* **a threat** is something or someone that **aims to exploit a vulnerability to gain unauthorized access**;
* **a likelihood** of a **potential vulnerability** being **exploited** within the construct of the organization’s threat environment. Likelihood of occurrence is a weighted factor **based on a subjective analysis** of the **probability** that a given threat or set of threats is capable of exploiting a given vulnerability or set of vulnerabilities.

## Risk Identification

Important consider that it's not a one-and-done activity, but it's a recurring process of identifying different possible risks, characterizing them, and then estimating their potential for disrupting the organization. 
This process is important to expose possible risks because what is not known cannot be protected. And employees at all levels of the organization are responsible for identifying risk.

## Risk Assessment

It's the process of identifying, estimating, and prioritizing risks to an organization's operations, assets, individuals, other organizations, and even the nation. Risk assessment has a broad meaning in comparison to risk identification because the risk assessment aligns each identified risk resulting from the operation of an information system with the goals, objectives, assets, or processes that the organization uses, which means it aligns with the organization's goals and objectives.

## Risk Treatment

What is the best action to take regarding the identified and prioritized risks?
This is the question that should be made in the risk treatment phase and the resulting decisions are always dependent on the attitude of the management toward risk and the availability of risk mitigation. In general, there are four classes of actions as follows:
avoidance:
acceptance:
mitigation:
transfer:

Risk Priorities
Risk Tolerance
