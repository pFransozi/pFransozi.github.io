<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

Here we'll continue ISC² CC summary, talking about risk management process concepts. This is a sequence of a story started [in this link]({% post_url 2022-09-21-ISC2-CC-Foundational-Concepts-I %})


 
First, before we reach our target, let's talk a little bit about concepts and risk management process.
Why do we have to learn about concepts? Frankly, we do not have, except if we want to have tools to handle the chaos of reality. Concepts help us to see reality a little bit less chaotic, helping us to manage real-life situations, both the most ordinary and the most extraordinary. 
Our scenarios are on risk management in a cybersecurity context and nowadays it means any risk that can affect confidentiality, integrity and availability of a business. For that, risk management must become a process, an ongoing concern, in any organization, by which any risk must be assess and analyze in a continuous and comprehensive way. And as a member of an security team, you will work through risk assessment, analysis, mitigation, remediation and communication.
So, this story covers:
risk management terminology;
risk identification;
risk assessment;
risk treatment;
risk priorities.

Risk Management Terminology
An asset is something, tangible or intangible, in need of protection because it has value to the organization;
A vulnerability is a weakness or flaw in an organization's protection of its assets, including information, which could cause a risk event to occur if triggered or exploited by a threat. The security teams chase vulnerabilities in an effort to prevent them from being exploited;
A threat is something or someone that aims to exploit a vulnerability;
The likelihood is the probability of a potential vulnerability being exploited and it is a weighted factor based on a subjective analysis.

Risk Identification
Important consider that it's not a one-and-done activity, but it's a recurring process of identifying different possible risks, characterizing them, and then estimating their potential for disrupting the organization. 
This process is important to expose possible risks because what is not known cannot be protected. And employees at all levels of the organization are responsible for identifying risk.
Risk Assessment
It's the process of identifying, estimating, and prioritizing risks to an organization's operations, assets, individuals, other organizations, and even the nation. Risk assessment has a broad meaning in comparison to risk identification because the risk assessment aligns each identified risk resulting from the operation of an information system with the goals, objectives, assets, or processes that the organization uses, which means it aligns with the organization's goals and objectives.
Risk Treatment
What is the best action to take regarding the identified and prioritized risks?
This is the question that should be made in the risk treatment phase and the resulting decisions are always dependent on the attitude of the management toward risk and the availability of risk mitigation. In general, there are four classes of actions as follows:
avoidance:
acceptance:
mitigation:
transfer:

Risk Priorities
Risk Tolerance
